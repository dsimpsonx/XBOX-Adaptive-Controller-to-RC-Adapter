# XBOX-Adaptive-Controller-to-RC-Adapter
Arduino code for translating XBOX One Controller and XBOX Adaptive Controller input to PPM output for control of RC vehicles

The code is built around use of the XBOX Adaptive Controller as a connection hub, as this allows a range of different input options. With the code provided, users can operate any 2 channel RC sailing boat or 2 channel RC car using a large format joystick (e.g. UltraStik or Warfighter Engaged joysticks), a mouth operated joystick such as the Quadstick, a wheelchair joystick (via a FreedomWing adapter) or accessibility switches. Modifications to the code will allow operation of virtually any standard RC vehicle (even planes and drones) without modifications to the vehicle itself, except for perhaps needing to swap out the RF receiver for a different one.
